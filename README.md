- 👀 I’m interested in uncovering hidden stories within datasets, transforming raw numbers into actionable business insights, and building compelling data visualizations. I love tackling complex business problems with data-driven solutions!
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning diving deeper into Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) for analysis and predictive modeling, mastering advanced SQL techniques, and creating impactful dashboards with tools like Power BI and Tableau. Always eager to explore new ways data can drive decisions!
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data analysis projects, building insightful BI dashboards, or tackling data visualization challenges. Open to contributing to open-source projects or any initiative focused on deriving value from data. If you have an interesting dataset or business problem, let's connect!
